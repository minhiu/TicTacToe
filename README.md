Description: A human user plays a game of tic-tac toe from start to finish. The user initializes a tic-tac-toe game, chooses the amount of time they want to make a move, then gets assigned an icon at random. The user plays against an AI which gets assigned a different icon. Each player takes turns until the game ends in one of the players winning or a tie is reached. At this point, the user has the option to start another game.
